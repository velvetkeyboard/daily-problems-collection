[Daily Problem] Reverse a Linked List
Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Google:

Given a singly-linked list, reverse the list. This can be done iteratively or recursively. Can you get both solutions?

Example:

```
Input: 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0 -> NULL
Output: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL
```
